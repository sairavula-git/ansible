The ping module in Ansible is used to check the connectivity and reachability of remote hosts.
In this example, the playbook performs a ping test on all hosts defined in the inventory. The ping module is invoked without any additional parameters.

The ping module doesn't require elevated privileges, so there's no need for become: true or specifying a remote user. The ping module simply verifies if the hosts are reachable and if Ansible is able to establish a connection with them.

Executing this playbook will display the output indicating whether each host is reachable or not. A successful ping will result in a "pong" response, while an unreachable host will show a failure message.

Note: The ping module only checks the connection to the remote host and does not provide information about the overall system health or service availability. Its primary purpose is to validate the connectivity between Ansible and the hosts.

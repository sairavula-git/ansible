command module can be used to execute commands on remote hosts.
the main difference between the command and shell modules is that the command module executes commands directly without shell processing, while the shell module allows you to utilize shell-specific features. It's generally recommended to use the command module when possible to avoid potential shell-related issues, unless you specifically need shell functionality.
